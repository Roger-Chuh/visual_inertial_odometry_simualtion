# Visual_Inertial_Odometry_Simualtion
MATLAB simulation of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) &amp; visual-wheel odometry

This is MATLAB simulation for visual-odometry & visual-inertial odometry & visual-wheel odometry

* You can use this simulation belong your need
* I checked all the demo files whether it can be runned without any amendation, but the MATLAB version can be critical 
* I made this simulations on MATLAB 2019a

## Code Description 
(Each SIMx-files are in a group)
1. SIM1_w2Dfeat_demo.m is simple 2D simulation of camera
2. SIM2_w3Dfeat_demo.m is 3D simulation of camera with optical flow

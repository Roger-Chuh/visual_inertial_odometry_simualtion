# visual_inertial_odometry_simualtion
MATLAB simulation of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) &amp; visual-wheel odometry

This is matlab simulation for visual-odometry & visual-inertial odometry & visual-wheel odometry

* You can use this simulation belong your need
* I checked all the demo files whether it can be runned without any amendation, but the MATLAB version can be critical 
* I made this simulations on MATLAB 2019a

1. <SIM1_w2Dfeat_demo> is simple 2D simulation of camera
2. <SIM2_w3Dfeat_demo> is 3D simulation of camera with optical flow
